<h2>Summary</h2>
Dungeon Crawl is my submission for Ludem Dare 50, where the theme is "Delay the Inevitable". 
It is a point and click dungeon crawler where you want to take as long as possible to escape.

While adventuring in a dungeon lost to time, you were possessed by the Demon Lord Imp'a-Tient! 
He now is forcing you out of the dungeon so that he make wreak havoc upon the world. 
Thankfully you have just enough control over your body to hinder his progress. 
Try to keep yourself in the dungeon long enough so that Imp'a-Tient gets bored and decides to leave you alone.

I made this game over the course of 72 hours. The design and programming was done by me with some input from testers.
Art, sound effects, and visuals were acquired from Unity assets.

<h2>New Repository Update</h2>
<p>This project came from a previous repository that contained all 3rd party assets. Most art, music, and sfx files have now been witheld from the repository for redistribution purposes.</p>
